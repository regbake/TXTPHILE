# Welxome to .txtphile

This is the project for unit 2: 
  .TXTPHILE is a web-app based on the love of words and writing! 
  
  Users can upload, type, or search a selection of poetry. After obtaining a corpus, the user can view word frequencies of a single text or words in common between two texts. 
  
  Create an account and check out some poetry!
